ESP32 Temperature Monitoring PWM Control Board, Part No. FB6261

* DO NOT ATTEMPT TO POWER FANS FROM USB-C. Supplied power (5v-14V) to barrel connector
needs to match the voltage of the PWM fan (or other device) you are driving. Board has an onboard
self-resetting flex fuse rated at 4 amps.

* Device is flashed with an exmaple ESPhome image that has manual control over fans 
and enabled automatic control based the desired temperature setting. To place on 
WiFi network use 2.4G phone to connect to "AVFAN1 Fallback Hotspot" and
update SSID and PASSWORD. Once connected to your WiFi network, to access the webpage of
the device browse to http://avfan1.local

* For customization, downlaod the example (flashed) code from 
https://github.com/fpovoski/ESP32-Temperature-Monitoring-PWM-Control-Board
(avfan1.yaml). Also update WiFi and MQTT server credentials as required.

* Flash over USB or ethernet. To flash over USB use ESPhome Web Flasher https://web.esphome.io/
with the device powered and connected to your host machine.

* For Dallas style sensors (board preprogrammed with logger level: DEBUG), to get device ID follow
the ESPhome instructions: https://esphome.io/components/sensor/dallas.html.

* For adding Wemos style boards (i.e., relay) with the case installed  use the long (19mm) provided pins.
